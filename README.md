# Companies 2024

## Overview

- **Definition of a company**: s.995(1) defines a company as including all bodies or associations corporate or unincorporated, excluding partnerships.

- **Residence of companies**: Under s.6(1) ITAA36, a company is considered an Australian resident if it is either incorporated in Australia or, if not incorporated, carries on business in Australia and has central management and control in Australia.

- **Taxation of companies**: Companies are taxed at a flat rate without a tax-free threshold. For the 2019/20 year, the tax rate is either 30% or 27.5% for base rate entities (BRE).

## Taxation of Base Rate Entities (BRE)
- A company is a BRE if 80% or less of their income is passive, and their turnover is below $50 million.
- **Passive income** includes dividends (except non-portfolio), interest, rent, royalties, capital gains, and income from trusts/partnerships.

## Franking Credits
- Franking credits attached to dividends are limited to the amount of tax the company would have paid on the profits from which the distribution is made.

## Private Companies
- Payments to associates or excessive remuneration may be deemed as dividends by the FCT and disallowed as deductions. These amounts will be deemed unfrankable dividends.

## Taxable Income vs. Accounting Income
- The net profit or loss shown in the income statement (following accounting standards) may not correspond to taxable income under tax law.

## Tax Losses
- To deduct carry forward tax losses, a company must meet the **Continuity of Ownership test** or the **Similar Business test**.
- **Continuity of Ownership test**: More than 50% of voting, dividend, and capital rights must be owned continuously.
- **Similar Business test**: If the continuity test is not met, the company must prove it operates a business similar to the original one.

## Research & Development (R&D) Tax Incentive
- The R&D Tax Incentive allows companies to claim a tax offset for eligible R&D activities.
- **Eligibility**: Entities must be conducting eligible R&D activities and have notional deductions over $20,000.
- **Tax offset**: Small companies with a turnover below $20 million can claim a 43.5% refundable tax offset, while larger companies receive a 38.5% non-refundable offset.

## Capital Gains and Losses
- Companies cannot apply the CGT discount method, but capital losses are subject to continuity of ownership and business tests.

## Imputation System
- Companies must maintain a **franking account** to track tax credits that can be passed on to shareholders via franked dividends.
- **Benchmark Rule**: Requires that dividends in a franking period be franked at the same rate as the first dividend of that period.
- **Franking Deficit Tax (FDT)**: Arises when a company's franking debits exceed its credits at the end of the year.

## Payment of Tax
- Companies pay tax under the PAYG system through either a lump sum or quarterly instalments, submitted with their Business Activity Statement (BAS).
